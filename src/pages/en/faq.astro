    question: "How does therapy with Giovanna work?",
    answer: `I strive to create a supportive and confidential environment where you can freely explore your thoughts, emotions, and experiences. My goal is to adapt the therapeutic journey to your specific needs and help you reach your objectives.`
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if therapy is right for me?",
    answer: `Therapy can be beneficial for anyone, whether you are facing significant difficulties or simply desire a path of personal growth. There is no specific "condition" required to start: if curiosity drives you, that is often a good reason to try.

During the first session, I will ask you to fill out a mood questionnaire to help us better understand your needs. This allows us to focus on the areas you want to explore and build a personalized approach together.`
  },
  {
    question: "Is what I share confidential?",
    answer: `Yes, confidentiality is a fundamental basis of therapy. I will explain the limits of confidentiality during our first meeting so you can feel safe sharing your thoughts and experiences.

However, there are some circumstances where confidentiality might be limited, such as risks to your safety or legal obligations. I will discuss these situations openly to ensure clarity and transparency.`
  },
  {
    question: "How many sessions will I need?",
    answer: `The number of sessions depends on your personal needs and the goals you wish to achieve. For some, a few sessions are enough to address a specific issue, while others may benefit from longer-term support.

Generally, I recommend reviewing progress every 6-10 sessions to monitor how therapy is going and plan next steps. I offer both short-term and long-term pathways, depending on your preferences.`
  },
  {
    question: "What are the therapy costs?",
    answer: `The cost is 50 euros for a 50-minute session. If you have questions regarding the price or payment methods, please do not hesitate to contact me.`
  },
  {
    question: "What can I expect from the first appointment?",
    answer: `The first meeting is an opportunity to explore your goals and the difficulties you wish to address together. I will ask you questions to better understand your background and experiences, in order to develop a personalized plan that meets your needs.

This session also allows you to evaluate if I am the right person for you. Building a solid therapeutic relationship is crucial for the success of therapy, and I will be here to support you in this process.`
  },
  {
    question: "Why do we use questionnaires?",
    answer: `Questionnaires help us better understand your emotional and mental state, identifying areas where you might grow. They also serve to monitor progress over time.

If you prefer not to complete the questionnaires, I will respect your choice, and we will find another way together to make the therapeutic journey effective and comfortable.`
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I need to cancel or reschedule an appointment?",
    answer: `I understand that life can be unpredictable. If you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment, I ask that you notify me at least 48 hours in advance to avoid any charges.

Cancellations with less than 48 hours' notice or missed appointments may incur a charge. If I need to reschedule a meeting, I will try to give you as much notice as possible.`
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I want to end therapy?",
    answer: `If you wish to stop therapy, you are free to do so at any time. I invite you, if possible, to discuss it together during a session to facilitate a serene closure and address any doubts or concerns. If you prefer, you can also communicate this to me via email, in whichever way is simplest and most comfortable for you.`
