        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          My name is Giovanna Niola and I am a Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapist registered with the Order of Psychologists of Sardinia (1/SPS).
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I have over seven years of clinical experience gained in the English National Health Service (NHS), in hospital settings, and in the private sector.
          I support adults experiencing anxiety, stress, emotional difficulties, personal blocks, or complex moments in their lives.          
          My goal is to create a safe, welcoming, and non-judgmental space where you feel heard and supported towards greater well-being.

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-6">My Approach</h2>
      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          I integrate CBT tools to set clear and measurable goals. The process is collaborative and practical, often involving exercises between sessions.
        </p>
        
        <p class="mt-4">
          My work integrates various complementary therapeutic models:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Cognitive–Behavioural Therapy (CBT)</li>
          <li>Schema Therapy</li>
          <li>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</li>
          <li>Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This allows me to build personalized pathways that respect your pace and needs.
          I strongly believe in the value of the therapeutic relationship: an atmosphere of trust, authenticity, and collaboration is the heart of every possible transformation.

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-6">My Background</h2>
      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          After graduating in Psychological Sciences and Techniques at the University of Cagliari, I moved to the UK to continue my studies and specialize in psychotherapy at:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Surrey University</li>
          <li>Royal Holloway, University of London</li>
          <li>Birkbeck College – University of London</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Working in England gave me an international perspective and a deep sensitivity towards cultural differences, which I bring to my therapeutic practice today.
